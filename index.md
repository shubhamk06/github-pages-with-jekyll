# Welcome to my page 

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my learning this is basically my first page which I have made from github only.

There are various learning community out there is the world. Where you can learn thing easily but when we learn while doing is best way of learning in my opinion.

**Here are some of the stratergies which I follows before learning anyting:**
- first find out what kind of learner you are.
- if your know what kind of learner your are then make some area for it  like making auditory environment when you are auditory learner coz all kind of learner have to apply different ideas to learn more effectively coz we all have different brains.
- if you had  made area for learning gather material for learning for example audiobook or any other content.
